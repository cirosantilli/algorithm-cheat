# Hanoi tower

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi>

Generalizations TODO:

-   any start and end position

-   more than 3 pegs (Reve's puzzle).

    There exists no proved algorithm for more than 3 pegs, but it is conjectured that the Frame–Stewart algorithm solves those cases, and it has been checked up to large number of disks.
